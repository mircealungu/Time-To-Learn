The python version used to make these codes is 3.5.

The following libraries should be installed in order to make it work. 
First, you need to install pip (installing pip first is the easiest way to install everything else I think):

OS X -> sudo easy_install pip
Linux -> sudo apt-get install python-pip

Then, you can execute this commands:

python3.5 -m pip install requests
python3.5 -m pip install beautifulsoup4
python3.5 -m pip install dicttoxml
python3.5 -m pip install xmltodict (optional, in case you want to read a xml file back to a dictionary)

Note: Replace 3.5 with your python version accordingly. It should be at least version 3 or the code will not work.
